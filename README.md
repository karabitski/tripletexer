# Tripletexer - ruby client for tripletex.no API v2

## Getting started
Add tripletexer to your Gemfile
```ruby
gem 'tripletexer', '~> 0.1.0'
```
run bundle install

## Using tripletexer

Tripletex.no API documentation can be found here: https://tripletex.no/v2-docs/

This gem tries to fallow patterns of tripletex.no documentation, however not completely.

```ruby
client = Tripletexer.new

# start new session
client.token.session.create('your_consumer_token', 'your_employee_token')

client.invoice.search(Date.new(2017), Time.now.to_date).each do |invoice|
  # do something with invoice
end

# revoke token
client.token.session.destroy
```

When tipletex.no API returns a list tripletexer gem returns an instance of
enumerator, this way you never have to deal with pagination.

## TODO

Write some tests
